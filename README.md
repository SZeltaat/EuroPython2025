# EuroPython2025
My narrative of EuroPython 2025 in Prague

## General
- Link to the website: [EuroPython 2025](https://ep2025.europython.eu/)


## Workshops
### [Workshop 1: Rambo Python](https://ep2025.europython.eu/session/rambo-python)


Course material: https://github.com/Lenormju/python-royal/tree/english_translation

Mostly the tech stack we use at WSP: uv, ruff, mypy, pytest, pre-commit, ...

Got to play with streamlit a bit, which was fun.

Interesting take aways:

- [pydoit](https://pydoit.org/) for task management and cli automation
- [uv custom ca certificates](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/authentication/#custom-ca-certificates) for possible certificate problems

### [Workshop 2: GIL-free Python and the GPU](https://ep2025.europython.eu/session/gil-free-python-and-the-gpu-hands-on-experience)

Course material: https://learn.nvidia.com/dli-event
(Code: EUROPYTHON_GILFRPY_JUL25)

See the jupyter notebooks:  [no_gil_gpu.ipynb](Assets/ws2/no_gil_gpu.ipynb)

See the use of NVidia's nvic in [nvic.py](Assets/ws2/nvic.py)

Many tips and tricks on ThreadPoolExecutor and ProcessPoolExecutor both with and without the GIL. Also how to use the GPU with CUDA and Python.

### [Workshop 3: The Mighty Dot - Customize Attribute Access with Descriptors](https://ep2025.europython.eu/session/the-mighty-dot-customize-attribute-access-with-descriptors)

Course material: [mighty_dot.zip](Assets/ws3/mighty_dot.zip)

Very very interesting and well presented workshop by Mike M√ºller.

Take aways:

- A deep dive into properties and descriptors, also alternative ways to implement them.
- How and when to use them? What are the pitfalls?
- There is a WeakKeyDictionary in the `weakref` module to store weak references to objects, which can be useful for caching. Definitely something to look into.

### [Workshop 4: Speaking at EuroPython (or your favorite conference)](https://ep2025.europython.eu/session/speaking-at-europython-or-your-favorite-conference-yes-you-can)

Course material: [Presentation](Assets/ws4/SpeakingAtEuroPythonYesYouCan.pdf)

An interesting workshop on how to prepare a talk for EuroPython or any other conference, lots of tips and tricks.

Also prepared and presented a lightning talk for the first time, which was a fun experience.


## Talks

Here are some of the interesting talks I attended:

- What does good teamwork mean to you?
- Softwate development is a team sport.
    - Skilfully pass the ball and set the next person up for success.
- Put principles above processes.
- Ball passing in software development:
    - Pull requests: make a PR skilfully!
    - Code reviews: give feedback skilfully!
    - Apply feedback skilfully!
    - Ask for help skilfully!
    - Receive help skilfully!
    - Share status regularly!
    - To err is human!
    - To grow is human!
- Good teamwork is good business.
- [Google‚Äôs Project Aristotle](https://psychsafety.com/googles-project-aristotle/) found that psychological safety is the most important factor for high-performing teams. Definitely read the article!


### Talk: [How to deal with toxic people](https://ep2025.europython.eu/session/how-to-deal-with-toxic-people)

Resources:

- [The social contract of open source by Brett Cannon](https://snarky.ca/the-social-contract-of-open-source/)

Take aways:
- Understand the types of toxic feedback:
    - Entitlement: "Why is my problem not solved?"
    - Frustration: "Thanks for nothing!"
    - Attack: "ü§¨ U"
- Coping strategy:
    - Do not engage hot-headedly.
    - Go through your stress respoonse cycle:
    - Cool down
- Open source = No one owes you anything.
- Boundaries:
    - You deserve respect and decency.
    - Have a Code of Conduct and enforce it.
    - Don't accept abuse.


### Talk: [Design Pressure: The Invisible Hand That Shapes Your Code](https://ep2025.europython.eu/session/design-pressure-the-invisible-hand-that-shapes-your-code)

Resources:
- [Slides](https://speakerdeck.com/hynek/design-pressure)
- [Blog post by the speaker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhNSINolcSM&t=2s)
- [PyCon US 2025 version of the talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhNSINolcSM)
- [The rising sea (by Mathew Drury) / The harbor coding problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkBWb1fK6R8)

Take aways:
- Two pieces of code are coupled if they can only be understood by looking at both.
- Testable code is better code.
- The shape of your code should NOT be determined by the shape of your data.
- In software projects, you often have:
    - Database schemas (e.g. SQL tables)
    - API schemas (e.g. what your API sends/receives)
    - Business logic types (e.g. what your app actually works with in memory)
    - ORM models (e.g. how your code talks to the database)
    - These may look similar, but they serve different purposes and have different flexibility needs.
- If you force everything to use the same type (a ‚Äúfranken-type‚Äù), the rigid parts (e.g. the database) will limit flexibility everywhere.
    - Some parts (like the database) are harder to change.
    - Others (like your internal app logic) should be easy to change.
- It's better to define separate types in each layer.
    - Then, explicitly map between them (e.g. convert a DB object to an API response).
    - Yes, it‚Äôs a bit more work, but it keeps each part clean, flexible, and easy to maintain.
- Start with the `Domain model` based on your business logic:
    - This is the core logic of your app, independent of any external systems.
    - It should be clean, flexible, and easy to change.
- Complexity is not about how many keys I have to press ‚Äì it‚Äôs about how difficult it is to reason about the consequences of what I‚Äôm doing.

### Keynote: [Why it took 4 years to get a lock files specification](https://ep2025.europython.eu/session/why-it-took-4-years-to-get-a-lock-files-specification) by Brett Cannon

Resource: 
- [Slides](https://opensource.snarky.ca/Talks/2025/EuroPython/Slides)
- [PEP 751 ‚Äì A file format to record Python dependencies for installation reproducibility](https://peps.python.org/pep-0751/)
- [pylock.toml standard](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/pylock-toml/)

Thoughts and take aways:
#### Packaging and distribution
- Source distribution (sdist) is the source code of your project. Its format is:
    {project-name}-{version}.tar.gz
- Wheel distribution (wheel) also contains the source code, but bunch of metadata and compiled files. It's a zip file that gets copied "as is" to the environment. Its format is:
    {project-name}-{version}-{python-tag}-{abi-tag}-{platform-tag}.whl
- Please, please, please always include wheel distribution in your releases when pushing to PyPI.
#### Pyproject.toml
- pyproject.toml should at least contain:
    - [project] section with:
        - name
        - version
    - [build-system] section with:
        - requires
        - build-backend
- Don't do upperbounds on your dependencies in pyproject.toml, unless you have a very good reason to do so.
- Use environment markers to specify dependencies for different environments (e.g. for older Python versions).
#### Lock file
- You can have pylock.*.toml file for different purposes, e.g. one for all the newest versions of your dependencies and one for all the oldest versions of your dependencies.
- uv can both create and install from pylock.toml files.


### Talk: [Intuition vs. Reality: Surprising Truths in Python Performance](https://ep2025.europython.eu/session/intuition-vs-reality-surprising-truths-in-python-performance)

Resources:
- [Slides](https://ahaslides.com/codspeed)

Thoughts and take aways:
- Performance matters, because:
    - Cost savings
    - Sustainability
    - User experience and adoption
    - Competitive advantage

Lessons learned:
Below we handle a series of cases with the same question: Which one is faster?

- ‚ûï First case, sum(generator) vs len(list comprehension):
    - sum(1 for x in arr if x % 2 == 0)
    - len([x for x in arr if x % 2 == 0])

    - Answer: Context switching between the generator and the list comprehension takes time, so the list comprehension is faster. It uses however much more memory (x10_000).

- üî° Second case, concatanating strings with .join() or with +:
    - ''.join(strings)
    - for s in strings: concatanated += s 
    
    - Answer: While using +=, the string is copied into a new larger string instance every time, which is very inefficient. So .join() is much faster. Join pre-allocates the full string size and copies each string once.
    - Built-in functions are usually well optimized, so use them whenever possible.

- üóùÔ∏è Third case, list comprehension vs map():
    - [x * 2 for x in data]
    - list(map(lambda x: x * 2, data))

    - Answer: map() requires a context switch in each iteration to the lambda function (setup, pass arguments and teardown). So eventhough map() is well optimized in C, This operation is faster with list comprehension.

- üîÅ Fourth case, calculating factorial with recursion vs stack appraoch:
    - def factorial_recursive(n):
        if n == 0:
            return 1
        return n * factorial_recursive(n - 1)

    - def factorial_stack(n):
        stack = []
        result = 1
        while n > 0:
            stack.append(n)
            n -= 1
        while stack:
            result *= stack.pop()
        return result

    - Answer: The recursive approach has a lot of overhead due to function calls (pushing frames) and context switching, so the stack approach is faster.

- ü¶Ä Fifth case, getting x squared in python vs a Rust function:
    - x * x
    - calling rust_square(x) using Rust import from pyo3

    - Answer: This is a real simple operation and Python is very fast at it, so the Rust function is not faster.
    - The overhead of calling the Rust function and converting the types is too high.

- ü¶Ä Sixth case, Rust fibonacci vs python fibonacci:
    
    - Answer: in Rust, this runs as a native cpu code, purely algorithmic. It is also faster that CPython interpreter bytecode execution. So the Rust version is much faster.

- ü¶Ä Seventh case, Binary search in Python vs. Rust:
    - in both cases, a list of 10_000 sorted random integers is passed.

    - Answer: Transforming a python list to Rust's Vec is an O(n) operation, while the binary search is O(log n). So the Rust version becomes slower slower and as the list size increases.

- ü¶Ä Eighth case, Binary search in Python vs. Rust:
    - Now, we pass a pyo3 list to the Rust function and only access log(n) elements in the list directly from memory (so no conversion to Vec).

    - Answer: This is much faster, because we avoid the O(n) conversion to Vec and only access the elements directly from memory. So the Rust version is much faster.

## Lightning Talks
### Lightnig talk: How to say "No" more easily:
- Rule#1: Don't say "Yes" unless it's been 24 hours since the request.
- Rule#2: Estimate the time, energy and the cost. Then multiply it by 4. Alternatively: make an optimistic estimate, make a pessimistic estimate, then sum them up!
- Rule#3: Future you is gonna be at least as busy as present you.
- Rule#4: Tell your loved one(s) that you are going to say "No" to them by saying "Yes" to the oppurtunity.
- Rule#5: The "honor to be asked" is a trap. Don't fall for it.

## Sessions

### Session: [AI discussion panel](https://ep2025.europython.eu/session/ai-discussion-panel)
